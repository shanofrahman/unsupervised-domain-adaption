# unsupervised-domain-adaption

In this work, we explored two different style transfer-based domain adaptation techniques for myocardial infarction segmentation in LGE images. The necessity for domain adaptation arises from the difficulty of manually labeling LGE images due to their low intensity delineation. Consequently, there is a scarcity or absence of labeled LGE images available to train a supervised segmentation model. To address this challenge, we trained the segmentation module on bSSFP images. However, since it is impractical to train on one modality and perform inference on another, we employed stylization techniques to make the bSSFP images resemble the style of LGE images. Subsequently, a supervised model was trained on these stylized synthetic images.

By comparing the performance of the segmentation module using images stylized with RAIN and AdaConv, we observed that AdaConv based segementation model was performing poorly. To evaluate its further effectiveness, we devised two additional scenarios for pre-training and segmentation. In one scenario, we used LGE images as the target style during both pre-training and segmentation, while in the other scenario, we employed the patient's corresponding LGE image as the style during segmentation. The results showed a significant improvement in the segmentation model based on AdaConv-stylized images. These findings led us to conclude that AdaConv's style exploration capabilities are not as extensive as those of RAIN with five epsilon iterations. Moreover, the enhanced performance suggests that equipping AdaConv with a gradient-based style exploration mechanism would likely yield a notable improvement in the segmentation model's performance.
